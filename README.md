Hide Follower Count

This plugin is intended to hide the follower count on the web version of Threads. 
It only works (in v1.0) if you start from www.threads.net/@username, 
and will become ineffective if you navigate to the feed and back. 
You can navigate to notifications and back with no issue. 
Hopefully a future version will be effective regardless of navigation.

I personally have www.threads.net/@alice.phoenix.official as my default autocomplete in Chrome; 
I also created a shortcut to that URL on my Chrome home/new tab screen.

Thanks for trying it out!
